# :rocket: Installation Guide

## üíªFor developers 
1. Install Python, atleast Python3

2. Clone this repository to your local system at a suitable directory/location of your choice

3. Start a terminal session, and navigate to the directory where the repo has been cloned

4. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:
```
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
5. Ensure that you export the PYTHONPATH variable to the main project folder in the environment variables. This is essential for your Python scripts to locate and import the project modules correctly.

### Telegram Setup
1. Begin by downloading and installing the Telegram desktop application for your system from the official website: [Telegram Desktop](https://desktop.telegram.org/).

2.  Log in to your Telegram account. In the Telegram app, search for "BotFather." Click on "Start" to initiate a conversation with BotFather. Enter the following command: /newbot

3.  Follow the on-screen instructions to choose a name for your bot. After naming your bot, select a username for your bot, which should end with "bot" (as instructed in the Telegram interface).

4.  Once you've configured your bot, BotFather will confirm the creation and provide you with an API TOKEN. Copy this token for future use.

5.  In the Telegram app, search for your newly created bot by entering its username. Open the bot's chat to access its details.

6.  Right-click on the chat with your bot in the Telegram app. Copy the chat's ID as CHAT_ID for future reference.

7.  Set both the CHAT_ID and API_TOKEN as environment variables on your computer. These variables are essential for your bot to interact with Telegram.

8.  Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root folder. Run the command: ```python src/TeleBot.py``` in the terminal. A successful run will generate a message in your terminal, indicating that "TeleBot: Started polling."

9.  After a successful run, go to your bot on Telegram. Enter the "/start" or "/menu" command to initialize your bot, and you're all set to track your expenses!

### Discord Setup

1. Start by downloading and installing the Discord desktop application for your system from the following official website: [Discord Download](https://discord.com/download).

2. Visit the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create a new application. Follow the steps in this guide to create your Discord bot: [Creating Your First Bot](https://guide.pycord.dev/getting-started/creating-your-first-bot).

3. Give your bot a unique name and customize its avatar. Important: Ensure that your bot's name does not include "Discord." Applications with "Discord" in their name may not function correctly.

4. Once you've created your bot, it will be provided with a DISCORD_TOKEN. Make sure to copy this token as you'll need it later.

5. From the Discord Developer Portal, configure your bot with the necessary permissions and rights. This ensures it can interact with servers and channels.

6. Create a server on Discord where your bot will operate. Inside this server, create a dedicated channel for your bot. Copy the CHANNEL_ID of this channel for future reference.

7. Set the DISCORD_TOKEN and CHANNEL_ID as environment variables on your computer. These variables will be used by your bot to connect to the correct server and channel.

8. Open your terminal and navigate to the project's root folder. Run the command: ```python src/DiscordBot.py``` in the terminal. A successful run will generate a message in your terminal, indicating that "Shard ID None has connected to Gateway."

9. After a successful connection, go to your bot on Discord and enter the "#menu" command. Your bot is now ready to track your expenses!

## Testing with Pytest

1. Ensure that all necessary environment variables are correctly set on your computer. These variables are crucial for the functioning of your bot and test environment:

    - DISCORD_TOKEN: Your Discord bot's token.
    - CHANNEL_ID: The ID of the Discord channel your bot operates in.
    - API_TOKEN: The API token for your Telegram bot.
    - CHAT_ID: The ID of the chat where your Telegram bot operates.
    - PYTHONPATH: Set the PYTHONPATH variable to the main project folder. This helps your Python scripts locate and import project modules correctly.

2. Navigate to the FinBot/test/unit folder in your project directory. In your terminal, run the following command:
```
  python -m pytest
```
  After running the tests, you should see a summary indicating the number of test failures and passes.

Some possible future enhancements are as follows:
1.	Generative AI integration with this software 
2.	Category management functionality in Discord.
3.	Convert into a Dockerized application.
4.	Calender widget for discord Bot.
